easy arrays tasks

1. MinusZeroPlus

In a one-dimensional array, rearrange the elements so that negative elements go first, then zero elements, and then positive elements. Do not change the relative position of elements.

2. Radius

In a one-dimensional array with an even number of elements (2N) there are the coordinates of N points the plane. They are arranged in the following order: x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, etc. Determine the minimum radius of a circle centered at the origin, which contains all the points.

3. FourDigits

An array of n four-digit natural numbers is given. Display only those numbers, for which the amount the first two digits is equal to the sum of the last two.

4. SortThird

Two ordered arrays A and B are given. Form an ordered array C from those two.

5. LongestZero

Array A is given. Find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements of the array, that are equal to zero.

6. MoveK

Array A is given. Cyclically shift the elements of the array K elements to the right (left).

7. MagicSquare

An integer n-th order square matrix is given. Determine if it is a magic square (the sums of the elements in all rows and columns are the same).

8. MoveElements

An integer square matrix is given. Find the largest element in each row and swap in place with an element of the main diagonal.

9. OddNumbers

Write a program that determines the sum of n-digit numbers containing only odd numbers. Determine also how many even digits in the sum is found.

10. CountWords

A string containing random text is given. How many words are there in the text? How many numbers are there in the text?
